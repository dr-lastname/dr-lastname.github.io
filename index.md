# Hi! This is H. B. Acharya.

I'm an Assistant Professor, now at the Rochester Institute of Technology, and an old geek. - I started out interested in biology, then spent so much time playing with computers I am now a computer scientist. 

As a programmer, I completely understand how important it is to divide our work into modules; but it is in intersections and gaps, where fields collide, that the most creative ideas come from. So my interests cover more than one area.
  - Networks, Equipment, and Protocols.
  - Security and Privacy.
  - Distributed Systems.
  
Here are a couple of ideas I'm interested in. (Looking for Ph.D students!)

1. We see the Internet as a hierarchy - a few backbone ISPs, like Level-3 and Cogent, provide services to smaller ISPs; these provide service to still smaller ones, and so on down to the consumer. But this model is now being displaced by Content Delivery Networks, owned by Google etc. What does this mean for us end users?
