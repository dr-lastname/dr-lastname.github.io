# Hi! H. B. Acharya Here.

I'm an Assistant Professor at the Rochester Institute of Technology, and an old geek. 

As a programmer, I completely understand how important it is to divide our work into modules; but it is in intersections and gaps, where fields collide, that the most creative ideas come from. So my interests cover more than one area.
  - Networks, Equipment, and Protocols.
  - Security and Privacy.
  - Distributed Systems.
  
## Research Interests.

Here are a couple of ideas I'm interested in. (Looking for Ph.D students!)

1. We see the Internet as a hierarchy. A few backbone ISPs, like Level-3 and Cogent, provide services to smaller ISPs; these provide service to still smaller ones, and so on down to the consumer. But this model is now obsolete: the Telecom giants are being displaced by Content Delivery Networks, owned by Google, Cloudflare, etc. What does this mean for us end users?
  - Do censors in a central (backbone) ISP, in say Russia, affect users in other countries? 
  - Can multi-path routing schemes (MIRO, YAMR) let us circumvent such censors?
  - How do CDNs affect existing censorship or anti-censorship tools? 
 
2. How powerful are Software-Defined Networks? We see SDN mostly in small networks (Data Centers etc.), but it has started to appear in Internet infrastructure. 
  - If we build a hierarchy of models, of increasing power (OpenFlow , OpenStack, P4, DPU), what new capabilities become available at each level?
  - Can we, for instance, develop full-scale firewalls (as opposed to IP blacklists)? How about Network Intrusion Detection? Decoy Routing?
  - Is it possible to build future architectures (ICN, MobilityFirst, XIA) on such infrastructure?

## Teaching Interests.

I like to keep my teaching close to actual practice. There is a gap between CS _concepts_ and SE or IT _techniques_, but they need to speak to each other. Often.

1. I currently teach Network Security. 
  - We dig into packet dumps with wireshark, to look at protocols (DNS, TLS).
  - Link layer attacks, firewalls, and VPN.
  - Forensics: flow tools, IDS, and some exposure to SIEM.

2. In the past, I've taught Networks, Distributed Systems, and Programming / Data Structures.
(I can also teach Operating Systems, Algorithms, and Formal Languages, though only at the UG level.)
