# Hi! This is H. B. Acharya.

I'm an Assistant Professor, now at the Rochester Institute of Technology, and an old geek. 

As a programmer, I completely understand how important it is to divide our work into modules; but it is in intersections and gaps, where fields collide, that the most creative ideas come from. So my interests cover more than one area.
  - Networks, Equipment, and Protocols.
  - Security and Privacy.
  - Distributed Systems.
  
## Research Interests.

Here are a couple of ideas I'm interested in. (Looking for Ph.D students!)

1. We see the Internet as a hierarchy. A few backbone ISPs, like Level-3 and Cogent, provide services to smaller ISPs; these provide service to still smaller ones, and so on down to the consumer. But this model is now obsolete: the Telecom giants are being displaced by Content Delivery Networks, owned by Google, Cloudflare, etc. What does this mean for us end users?
  - Do censors in a central (backbone) ISP, in say Russia, affect users in other countries? 
  - Can multi-path routing schemes (MIRO, YAMR) let us circumvent such censors?
  - How do CDNs affect existing censorship or anti-censorship tools? 
 
2. How powerful are Software-Defined Networks?
